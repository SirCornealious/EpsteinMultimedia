Epstein Library Video Scraper

The DOJ has deliberatly made it nearly impossible to view many multi-media files in the Congressionally mandated Epstein Library. 
The purpose of this project it to allow the average person to browse the media.
The uploaded the multi media files as a .pdf, illegally in my personal opinion.

We are setting them free one step at a time. 

Contains a hybrid human/automated script to scrap Epstien Library multimedia files. 

Phase 1: Scrape multimedia, mostly video .pdf URLs. 
Phase 2: Extension-Probing each URL. 
Phase 3: Expose pedos.
